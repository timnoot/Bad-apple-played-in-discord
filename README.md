# Question and own versions
If you have any questions or you made your own version. Please let me know on discord timnoot#0001



# Info
This is abuse of the discord API since 15 bots were spamming messages. So I don't recommend doing this. On the other hand only 2195 messages were sent which were deleted later. So I think the impact on discord was not too bad.
